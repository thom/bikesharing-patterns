# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program - Project: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

This project builds a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction
problem on the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Setup Instructions

Download the project materials from our GitHub repository and then cd into the
```bikesharing-patterns``` directory.:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thom/bikesharing-patterns.git
cd bikesharing-patterns
```

Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and create a new
conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name deep-learning python=3
```

Enter your new environment:

```bash
conda activate deep-learning
```

Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter lab installed by doing
the following:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab
```

Run the following to open up the Jupyter lab server:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

In your browser, open ```Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb```. Follow the
instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project.
